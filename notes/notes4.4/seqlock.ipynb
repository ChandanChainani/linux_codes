    "Previous `readers-writer` lock may lead to `writer starvation` problem. A writer process can't acquire a lock as long as at least one reader process which acquired a lock holds it. So, in the situation when contention is high, it will lead to situation when a writer process which wants to acquire a lock will wait for it for a long time.\n",

    "对于 **写饥饿** 问题，seqlock的解决办法是有一个sequence number。每次写的时候都增加sequence number，其实也就类似于MVCC中的版本号。对于 **读锁** 有两种，第一种是block writer，这种和之前一样。\n",
    "\n",
    "另一种是不会 block writer，而是在进入critical section之前，先读取sequence number，然后进入critical section，读取完成后，再读取一遍sequence number，跟之前读取的数值比较，如果一样，说明读取中间没有writer操作，就返回。否则继续读取。\n",

    "实际上，写操作在操作前后需要给 sequence number 分别加1，以区分**正在更改**和**已经改完了**，后面代码会看到\n",
